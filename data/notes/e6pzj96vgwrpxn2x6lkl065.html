<p>Language: Unity3D using C#</p>
<p>Goal: Full 3D minimap</p>
<p>Approach: Uses a second camera, changing the Interpupillary distance (IPD) to shrink the world.</p>
<p>Unity3D's stereo camera automatically places itself at the location of the HMD. The IPD scaling and location scaling is done using Unity3D's built transform. Next, I changed the settings of the Minimap camera. Turned off the buffer clears so they render using the same Z-buffer. Then scaled the second Z-buffer by changing the near and far clipping plan to match the scale.</p>
<p>This works and shows up in world, while still being properly occluded. I then shift it based center of the map and location in world it.</p>
