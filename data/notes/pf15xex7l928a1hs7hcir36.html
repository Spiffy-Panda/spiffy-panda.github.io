<p>This is my strongest skill when compared with peers. </p>
<p>I was a math major and computer science major. Between the two of curriculums, I learned the mathematic core behind 3D simulations. CS gave a very application driven view of 3D vector, Quaternions, Homogeneous Coordinates, Scene Graphs, and Transforms Matrices. Math came at it from the other direction, it gave a strong foundation of vectorization, General Transformations Matrices, Eigen Vectors/Values, Inverting Functions/Matrices, and Numerical methods. Numerical Methods are particularly useful when working with data that needs integrated or interpolated. </p>
